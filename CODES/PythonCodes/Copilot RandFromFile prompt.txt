Modify #pso.py to allow reading the random number sequence from an external 
text file instead of using np.random.rand. Follow the steps below.
1. The pso function should take an additional input argument, which is the name of a text file. The default value of this input argument is an empty string. If the user-specified input value is an empty string, the code will use np.random.rand as it is doing in the current version. If not an empty string, each call to np.random.rand should be replaced with reading the corresponding number of random variables from the text file. In short, the text file replaces the pseudorandom number generator as the source of random numbers. 
2. The text file contains the random number sequence as a single column of numbers.
3. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that the text file contains the total number of pseudorandom numbers needed for a given search space dimensionality (nDim), number of PSO iterations, and number of PSO particles. No check of this condition is needed in the code.
4. Modify the documentation of the function according to the above changes.

Modify the test code #test_pso.py to include a test of the pso function with the new input argument for a text file named "random_numbers.txt". 

Confirm understanding before generating code.
